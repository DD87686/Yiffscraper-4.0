# Features
- Authorization via a API key - download posts which you have to be logged in to access
- Tag "autocomplete" - shows tags when you type, but clicking on them won't autocomplete them
- Debug areas - top: logging in/out | bottom: post downloading
- [v1.0.0-1.0.3] Preview posts (up to version 1.0.3, since it's currently extremely buggy and i can't be bothered to fix it)
- [v1.0.3+] Progress bar - Contains the currently downloaded amount, an estimated final download amount (and the download speed for v1.1.0+)
- [v1.1.0+] Skip Duplicates - don't re-download already downloaded posts (v1.1.0+)
- [v1.1.0+] Download History

(i think that's all of them, might've forgot some lmao)
